      At a ScienceOnline science communicators' conference and also at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences researchers hand out swabs to 60 volunteers so that to examine the genetic makeup of bacteria residing in their belly button and asked them how often they scrubbed them.
      The team found 2,368 bacterial species, 1,458 of which were new to science.
      Some belly buttons harbored as few as 29 species and some as many as 107, although most had around 67. An individual, who hadn't washed in several years, hosted two species of so-called extremophile bacteria that typically thrive in ice caps and thermal vents.
