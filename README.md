# Plotly deployment

## Background
Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.


This project consists of four technical analysis deliverables. 

  1: Creating a Horizontal Bar Chart
  2: Creating a Bubble Chart
  3: Creating a Gauge Chart
  4: Customizing the Dashboard
