## Background
In a study carried out in 2011, Rob Dunn and his team of ecologists took swab samples from 60 belly buttons of volunteers. The team found 2,368 bacterial species, 1,458 of which might be new to science. While some belly buttons harbored as few as 29 to as many as 107 species, most had around 67 kinds of germs (1).  

In this project we tried to visualize the demographic information, as well as the bacterial data for each de-identified volunteer. Specifically, the users can  identify the top 10 bacterial species of each volunteer.


This project consists of four technical analysis deliverables. 

  1. Creating a Horizontal Bar Chart
  2. Creating a Bubble Chart
  3. Creating a Gauge Chart
  4. Customizing the Dashboard

## The Horizontal Bar Chart
This iteractive horizontal bar chart will display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individualâ€™s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart (Figure 1).

## The Bubble Chart

The buble charts are also interactive and show the number of baceria harboured by the volunteer in question. The size of each bubble is relative to the number of bacteria on the subject's belly buttion (Figure 2).

The webpage deployed on GitHub is available at this address: [Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard](https://bhashemi2021.github.io/Plotly). 

The webpage screenshot is available in Figure 3.
